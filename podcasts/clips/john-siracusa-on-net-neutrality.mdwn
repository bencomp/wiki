"The difficulty I have trying to explain net neutrality to my mother, or to anyone else, is that it's very difficult to impart on them the thing that we all know in our gut, that this is the end of the Internet as we know it. If you don't have an interconnected network of computers that can all talk to each other but instead have an interconnected series of toll booths that you have to pay money for, for information to get from one person to another, that defeats the entire purpose of the Internet."
