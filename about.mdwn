This wiki is running [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info) on CentOS 6 with an [RPM](http://yum.greptilian.com/RPMS/noarch/ikiwiki-3.20120202-1.el6.noarch.rpm) I rebuild from a [ikiwiki Fedora spec file](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/ikiwiki).  I also had to rebuild a number of dependencies, which you can find at http://yum.greptilian.com

After installing the RPMs, I ran `ikiwiki --setup wiki.setup` on [this setup file](wiki.setup).

The source of this wiki ([markdown](markdown), mostly) is available at http://git.greptilian.com/?p=wiki.git
