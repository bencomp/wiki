How can I prevent GNOME for prompting for my ssh key password?

    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ ssh-add
    Enter passphrase for /home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa: 
    Identity added: /home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa)
    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ ssh server1.greptilian.com

A pop up appears:

> Enter password to unlock the private key
> 
> An application wants access to the private key
> 'pdurbin@beamish', but it is locked
>
> Password:
> 
> () Automatically unlock this key
> whenever I'm logged in
> 
> (Cancel)   (Unlock)

I click "Cancel" (twice) and see this back on the console:

    Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
    Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
    pdurbin@server1.greptilian.com's password: 

This is Fedora 17:

    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ cat /etc/redhat-release 
    Fedora release 17 (Beefy Miracle)
