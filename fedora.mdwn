Background: I'm planning to switch from a CentOS 6 workstation to one running Fedora 17.  Some things are different.  I have questions.

## How can I prevent GNOME from prompting for my ssh key password?

    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ cat /etc/redhat-release 
    Fedora release 17 (Beefy Miracle)
    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
    /run/user/pdurbin/keyring-Nq4yQX/ssh
    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ ssh-add
    Enter passphrase for /home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa: 
    Identity added: /home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa)
    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ ssh server1.greptilian.com

A pop up appears:

> Enter password to unlock the private key
> 
> An application wants access to the private key
> 'pdurbin@beamish', but it is locked
>
> Password:
> 
> () Automatically unlock this key
> whenever I'm logged in
> 
> (Cancel)   (Unlock)

I click "Cancel" (twice) and see this back on the console:

    Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
    Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
    pdurbin@server1.greptilian.com's password: 

For now, this is my workaround:

    [root@beamish ~]# cd /etc/xdg/autostart
    [root@beamish autostart]# grep Exec gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop
    Exec=/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=ssh
    [root@beamish autostart]# mv gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop.disabled
    [root@beamish autostart]# reboot

    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ ssh-add
    Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ exec ssh-agent bash
    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ ssh-add
    Enter passphrase for /home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa: 
    Identity added: /home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/pdurbin/.ssh/id_rsa)
    [pdurbin@beamish ~]$ ssh server1.greptilian.com
    Last login: Wed Jul 11 09:57:51 2012 from dhcp-0164953481-93-7f.client.fas.harvard.edu
    [pdurbin@server1 ~]$ 

The problem with this, however, is that I have to run `exec ssh-agent bash` and `ssh-add` every time I open a new terminal window!

## Fedora 16/17/??/20 random mouse clicking

Unfortunately, I'm suffering from this problem:

F17 cursor crazy - https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/users/2013-February/431969.html

http://major.io/2013/08/24/get-a-rock-solid-linux-touchpad-configuration-for-the-lenovo-x1-carbon/ makes me wonder if this has something to do with my settings at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf or /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-wacom.conf 

The former says, "Some devices have the buttons as part of the lower edge of the touchpad.  Pressing a button moves the cursor, causing cursor jumps and erroneous clicks." I'm definitely suffering from similar problems. Before making any changes, here are my current settings:

Strangely, it almost seems related to being plugged into power... if I touch and hold my finger on the touchpad while plugged into power, the cursor oscillates. When I unplug from power, the cursor is more stable. As of this writing I'm on Fedora 20. I don't see this behavior when I reboot into Windows.

I wonder if this is related. I do have a Lenovo ThinkPad X220 Tablet: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics#Cursor_jump

"The original configuration renders the touchpad quite useless, as it behaves very jumpily." -- https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X230#Touchpad

"Using Ubuntu 12.04, 64-bit version, installed on Lenovo X220 laptop. Fresh "default" install and settings configuration.  When the laptop is plugged into a power source, the touchpad's onscreen cursor (the white arrow that shows position) shakes excessively when trying to use the touchpad to control the cursor." --  Bug #1028617 “Cursor shakes violently when connected to power so...” : Bugs : “xserver-xorg-input-synaptics” package : Ubuntu - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-synaptics/+bug/1028617
