## How to avoid letting IRC distract you

### Use `/set activity_hide_targets`

> If you don't want to see window activity in some certain channels or queries, list them here. For example `#boringchannel =bot1 =bot2`. If any highlighted text or message for you appears in that window, this setting is ignored and the activity is shown. -- http://irssi.org/beginner/

#### Show your current activity_hide_targets setting

    /set activity_hide_targets

#### Update your activity_hide_targets setting

    /set activity_hide_targets freenode/#salt freenode/#openstack freenode/#vim freenode/##infra-talk freenode/#cobbler

#### Clear your activity_hide_targets setting

    /set -clear activity_hide_targets

### Use `/ignore`

#### Show your current ignores

    /ignore

#### Add an ignore rule

This rule says to ignore the JOINS, PARTS, QUITS, etc, except for certain channels.

    /ignore -except freenode/#crimsonfu,freenode#geeknight JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS

#### Remove the ignore rule you just added

Use the exact string as above but put a minus sign before each of the levels (JOINS, PARTS, etc.)

    /ignore -except freenode/#crimsonfu,freenode#geeknight -JOINS -PARTS -QUITS -NICKS
