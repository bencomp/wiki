## resize2fs for XFS

For ext2/ext3/ext4 you can run `resize2fs /path/to/device` after resizing a logical volume with `lvextend --size +15G /path/to/device` but for XFS can't use `resize2fs`.  You'll get an error like this:

    [root@server1 ~]# resize2fs /dev/mapper/server1_storage_vg-vm_backups
    resize2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
    resize2fs: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/mapper/server1_storage_vg-vm_backups
    Couldn't find valid filesystem superblock.
    [root@server1 ~]# 

Instead, pass `-r` or `--resizefs` to `lvextend` (which seems to call `xfs_growfs`).  If you forget to to this, you can re-run `lvextend` but of course you'll probably want to set the size explicitly (i.e. `--size 30G`) rather than as an increase (i.e. `--size +15G).
