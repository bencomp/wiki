This wiki is running [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info) on CentOS 6 with an [RPM](http://yum.greptilian.com/RPMS/noarch/ikiwiki-3.20120202-1.el6.noarch.rpm) I rebuild from a [ikiwiki Fedora spec file](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/ikiwiki).  I also had to rebuild a number of dependencies, which you can find at <http://yum.greptilian.com>.

After installing the RPMs, I ran `ikiwiki --setup [wiki.setup](wiki.setup)`

This wiki is written in [[markdown]], which I like well enough.
