Starting mysqld for the first time

    [root@server1 ~]# service mysqld start
    Initializing MySQL database:  Installing MySQL system tables...
    OK
    Filling help tables...
    OK

    To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
    support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

    PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
    To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

    /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
    /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h server1.greptilian.com password 'new-password'

    Alternatively you can run:
    /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

    which will also give you the option of removing the test
    databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
    strongly recommended for production servers.

    See the manual for more instructions.

    You can start the MySQL daemon with:
    cd /usr ; /usr/bin/mysqld_safe &

    You can test the MySQL daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
    cd /usr/mysql-test ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

    Please report any problems with the /usr/bin/mysqlbug script!

                                                               [  OK  ]
    Starting mysqld:                                           [  OK  ]
    [root@server1 ~]# 

Show databases, users, run `/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation`, show again:

    NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MySQL
          SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!


    In order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current
    password for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and
    you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
    so you should just press enter here.

    Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
    OK, successfully used password, moving on...

    Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL
    root user without the proper authorisation.

    Set root password? [Y/n] Y
    New password: 
    Re-enter new password: 
    Password updated successfully!
    Reloading privilege tables..
     ... Success!


    By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
    to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
    them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
    go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
    production environment.

    Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
     ... Success!

    Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
    ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

    Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
     ... Success!

    By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
    access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
    before moving into a production environment.

    Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
     - Dropping test database...
     ... Success!
     - Removing privileges on test database...
     ... Success!

    Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
    will take effect immediately.

    Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
     ... Success!

    Cleaning up...



    All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MySQL
    installation should now be secure.

    Thanks for using MySQL!
